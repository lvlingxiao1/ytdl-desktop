## Overview

This is a project for a YouTube Downloader. It uses Tauri for building desktop application, React for UI library, Vite for bundling, and Bun for package manager/TypeScript runtime.

## Testing

```sh
bun run tauri dev
```

Note: not `cd src-tauri; cargo run`, this does not work
